# OxyNews---Mobile-Apps
This was the final group project for my Mobile Apps which focused on Android Studio app development
The purpose of the app was to provide students at Occidental College a more convient and Social-Media-like method of reading campus news
The app was an overall success, but due to time and scope limitations we were unable to automate the app
This is a copy of the project as the original github repo is linked to a school email which will be deprecated
My primary responsibilty was the development of the Settings page and functionality. Additionally, I created the app icon and solved merging conflicts
